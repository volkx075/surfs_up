# Surfs Up
## Purpose
I created a buisness plan on opening a Surf and Shake Shop in Hawaii. W. Avy, a possible investor, wants us to analyze the weather as the weather can be a big factor on whether a surf and shake shop will succeed or not before he invests. After our intial analysis of the weather, he would like us to compare the weather in June and December.
